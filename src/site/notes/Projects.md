## Sowing in the Sand: Environmental Aid and Vegetation Recovery in the Sahara
- **Description:** This study analyzes the spatial effectiveness of environmental aid projects on vegetation health in the Sahara, using NDVI as the outcome measure. Leveraging high-resolution spatial econometric methods, it constructs concentric buffers (25 km, 50 km, 100 km, 150 km) around each project location and estimates fixed-effects regressions at both pixel and ADM2 levels. Results need to be confirmed.

## No plan, No Aid?
- **Description:** This study examines the relationship between changes in adaptation aid and the implementation of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) in recipient countries. Using a staggered difference-in-differences framework and data from the OECD CRS dataset, it isolates the effect of NAP adoption on received adaptation aid, finding that NAPs adoption tends to reduce received adaptation aidâ€”highlighting the importance of recipient strategies and targeted aid for global climate adaptation goals.

## Under the Green Canopy
- **Description:** This project employs an advanced machine learning approach, ClimateFinanceBERT, to classify development finance projects in the OECD CRS dataset by their climate-related objectives (mitigation, adaptation, environmental). The study replicates and updates analyses of public climate finance determinants, identifying key factors influencing climate finance allocation and offering a scalable framework for monitoring financial flows aimed at addressing climate change holistically. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Cracking the Code
- **Description:** This research leverages NLP and machine learning techniques (e.g., BERTopic) to enhance classification of development finance projects using narrative descriptions from over 5 million entries in the OECD CRS dataset. By uncovering hidden topics within project texts, it provides deeper insights into donor priorities, recipient needs, and overall development funding strategies, improving our understanding of development finance mechanisms. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
