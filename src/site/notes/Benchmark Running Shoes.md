## Detailed Notes

### Hoka Clifton 9
- **Comfort:** Exceptionally cushioned with a plush midsole‚Äîideal for longer, slower runs when foot fatigue needs to be minimized.
- **Reactivity:** Moderate pop underfoot; smooth ride but not as ‚Äúspringy‚Äù as some others.
- **Durability:** Logged ~600 km before midsole cushioning noticeably declined.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Long-distance recovery runs  
  - Base-mileage building  
- **Personal Note:** I rotated these through high-mileage weeks and found them unbeatable for comfort, though I replaced them once cushioning started to feel flat.

---

### Hoka Clifton 10
- **Comfort:** Equally plush as Clifton 9, with updated foam that still prioritizes a soft ride.
- **Reactivity:** Noticeably more responsive than the Clifton 9‚Äîbetter toe-off spring for tempo runs.
- **Durability:** Still logging miles; expected to last similarly to Clifton 9 (~600 km).
- **Use Case:**  
  - Long runs when you want extra bounce  
  - Mixed easy/tempo sessions  
- **Personal Note:** This is my current long-run shoe‚Äîkeeps your legs fresh even if you pick up the pace occasionally.

---

### Saucony Ride 17
- **Comfort:** Less plush than the Clifton series, but still plenty cushioned for daily training.
- **Reactivity:** A bit snappier than Clifton 9, thanks to PWRRUN midsole‚Äîgood for moderate pickup work.
- **Durability:** More robust outsole rubber and reinforced upper; has outlasted my Clifton 9 pairs in mileage.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Everyday easy-to-moderate runs  
  - Mixed long/easy days when durability matters  
- **Personal Note:** I reach for these when I know I‚Äôll accumulate high weekly miles without replacing shoes too often.

---

### Hoka Mafate
- **Comfort:** Surprisingly cushioned for a trail-focused shoe; keeps feet comfortable over rocks and roots.
- **Reactivity:** Lightly reactive‚Äîenough pop to feel quick on undulating trail terrain without sacrificing stability.
- **Durability:** Midsole and outsole hold up well in rough terrain; expect moderate longevity (~500 km on mixed trails).
- **Use Case:**  
  - All-terrain trail runs  
  - Moderate- to long-distance trail routes  
- **Personal Note:** Love the balance of cushioning and responsiveness‚Äînever too heavy despite the aggressive tread.

---

### Saucony Peregrine 13
- **Comfort:** Firmer underfoot than Mafate; adequate but not plush.
- **Reactivity:** Low‚Äîprimarily designed for maximum traction and protection on technical surfaces.
- **Durability:** Solid rock plate and durable lugs; excellent for very rocky or muddy trails.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Technical trail runs (steep, rocky, or rooty sections)  
  - Shorter, more intense trail sessions where grip is paramount  
- **Personal Note:** When I know I‚Äôm tackling sharp rocks or very uneven singletrack, these lock in far better than any other shoe in my rotation.

---

### Asics Novablast 4
- **Comfort:** Snug fit with a lively FF BLAST midsole‚Äîplenty of cushioning without feeling sloppy.
- **Reactivity:** High‚Äîexcellent spring for interval work and tempo sessions.
- **Durability:** Moderate outsole life; holds up for ~400‚Äì500 km if used primarily on road.
- **Use Case:**  
  - Speed workouts (track repeats, fartleks)  
  - Short tempo runs when I need maximum rebound  
- **Personal Note:** This is my go-to for any session where I want to feel energy return and pick up the pace. Great ‚Äúfast‚Äù shoe that still feels smooth.
