## 🌍 Climate Finance & National Adaptation Plans (NAPs)

**Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Authors:** Pierre Beaucoral, Michaël Goujon, Sébastien Marchand  
**Status:** Preliminary (Do not cite without permission)  
**Keywords:** Climate finance, NAPs, Adaptation aid, Double Machine Learning (DML), Donor behavior

### 📌 Overview

This paper explores whether adopting a **National Adaptation Plan (NAP)** increases a country’s access to **climate adaptation finance**. The authors build a theoretical model and use advanced econometric methods (including **Double Machine Learning**) to analyze adaptation aid flows from 2013–2023.

---
### 🧠 Key Concepts

- **NAPs**: Tools for mainstreaming climate adaptation into national policy; signal both vulnerability reduction and institutional capacity.
- **Donor types**:
    - **Donor V (Vulnerability-driven)**: Prioritizes aid to countries with high vulnerability and low capacity.
    - **Donor C (Capacity-driven)**: Rewards countries with strong institutions and planning capacity (e.g., NAP adopters).

---

### 📈 Theoretical Model

A **signaling game** is modeled between:
- **Recipients**: Choose whether to adopt NAP (signal reform).
- **Donors**: Allocate aid based on perceived vulnerability (ν) and capacity (x).

**Key insight**:  
NAP adoption reduces perceived vulnerability (−) but increases perceived capacity (+). Donors weigh these signals differently, affecting aid allocation.

---

### 📊 Empirical Strategy

- **Data**: OECD CRS, NAP Central (UNFCCC)
- **Period**: 2013–2023
- **Methodology**:
    - OLS regression
    - 2SLS (instrument: distance from equator)
    - **Double Machine Learning (DML)** to address high-dimensional confounding and treatment endogeneity

### 🔍 Main Findings

| Method        | Effect of NAP on Adaptation Aid |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| OLS           | No significant effect           |
| 2SLS          | Positive but imprecise          |
| DML (ATE)     | Positive and significant        |
| IV-DML (LATE) | Even stronger effect            |

🧠 **Interpretation**: Traditional methods underestimate the impact. DML reveals that **NAPs significantly increase aid**, especially where donors reward governance signals.

### 🧭 Policy Tree Insights (Heterogeneous Treatment Effects)

Most benefit from NAPs goes to:

- Countries with **low revenue mobilization efficiency**
- Countries with **low GDP + poor trade access**
- Countries with **high vulnerability + low institutional quality**

---

### 🧩 Implications

- **For recipients**: Adopt NAPs not only to plan for climate risks but to signal capacity and unlock more aid.
- **For donors**: Be aware of mixed signals (reduced vulnerability vs. improved governance) and adjust allocation criteria accordingly.

### 🧪 Future Research

- Long-term effects of NAP adoption
- Interaction with mitigation finance
- Role of symbolic vs. substantive adoption
